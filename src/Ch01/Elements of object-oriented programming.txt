Modeling: -
    A model is a representation of reality.
    Modeling is crucial in object-oriented programming.
    We may model anything.
    The tricky part: what to include in your models.

Example (modeling a car): -
    For Sales: Price, Make, Model, Seats, Milage
    For Rideshare: Passengers, Trunk Size
    For Parking: Size

Encapsulation: -
    Keeping data and operations within their models.
    Models must only include information about themselves.
    Operations must be concise.
    Example - no data about gas price in the car class.

Classes: -
    The C++ construct for models.
    Classes contain members of 2 types: data and functions.
    Example - Car.make(), Car.paint()
    An instance of a class is known as an object.

Access Specifiers: -
    Members may be public or private
    Public members are accessible by any part of the code.
    Private members are only accessible within the class.
    Protected members are accessible in inherited classes.

Inheritance and Polymorphism: -
    A class may have subclasses based on it.
    A subclass may inherit members from the superclass.
    Example - Animal.legs, Dog.legs, Bird.wings
    Polymorphism: sibling classes.
